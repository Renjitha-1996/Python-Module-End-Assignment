# Python-Module-End-Assignment

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing employee data from ABC company to provide a comprehensive report on various aspects such as team distribution, positions, age groups, and salary patterns. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, and the analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical evaluation, and graphical representations.

By completing this project, we demonstrate our skills in Python programming, data analysis, and effective communication of insights.


# Project Objectives

# Preprocessing:

*. Replace the height column values with random numbers between 150 and 180.
*. Ensure consistency and integrity of the dataset.

# Analysis Tasks:

*. Task 1: Determine the distribution of employees across teams and calculate the percentage split.
*. Task 2: Segregate employees by their positions within the company.
*. Task 3: Identify the predominant age group among employees.
*. Task 4: Determine which team and position incur the highest salary expenditure.
*. Task 5: Investigate correlation between age and salary.

# Graphical Representation:

*. Create visualizations for each analysis task using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

# Insights:

*. Highlight key trends, patterns, and correlations from the data analysis.

# Tools Used

*. Programming Language: Python
*. Libraries:
    1. pandas for data manipulation
    2. numpy for numerical computations
    3. matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
